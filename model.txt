Please note that the data model of the RPHA database has been conveived a few decades ago and as such it still reflects certain technological constraints that are no longer relevant. Here I will give a detailed (but not exhaustive) description of this model.
There are two main types of records: poems and witnesses. (There are actually more than that. Some additional information about poems could only be stored in separate records. See more at fields V91 and V161.)
A poetical record contains information about the work itself, links to other works and references to known sources. The database does not store the full texts of the works. (There have been proposals to add links to these records pointing to the digitized contents of the works. This project has been strugling to progress as planned due to technical and other impediments. There exists a few working examples.)
Witness tpye records give a short description of the source and a list of known works within that source, which are also present in the database. 
All the fields are noted with the letter 'V' and a following number.
The system of genres within the database is a complex tree sturcture, with each node corresponding to a 3 digit code. A verse can be associated with any number of genres anywhere in the hierarchy. I have given a list of the genres and their relations under the 'GENRE' title with translations and alternative translations into English. (Please note that this translation is still a work in progress and has not been revised by a native speaker.)
Every field that contains names' of persons have the same structure. Every name is described with 3 sets of fields: surname, forename and any additional information about the person. (For example if the uncertainty of the name can be expressed here or if only the monogram is known.) Fields that contain names are: V5, V15 and V31.
The fields describing the information within the colophon (V32) and acrostic (V35) also share the same structure
Fields with multiple predefined values have corresponding keys (letters or numbers) paired to their values. In these cases only the keys are present in the data set.
To my understanding the current online version consists of an XML file containing all the data and a JAVA application to govern that data.Since the data set is stored in an XML file there are no distinc datatypes for arrays, dates etc. Also for the sake of conserving space lists are represented in one string where every element is delimited by a '%' character. If needed an export of the data is available in an XML file here: https://github.com/simonzsolt/rpha_XML/blob/master/export.2016.04.05.19.10.xml
I am currently working on porting the existing database to a more current (Javascript, NoSQL) platform. As soon as I have it, I will update you on the redesigned model.
